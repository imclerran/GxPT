Nothing is uploaded until you press `Send`, and requests are sent over HTTPS (encrypted HTTP). However, your messages must be sent to the AI model provider. This is done via OpenRouter. Your messages are sent to OpenRouter, which routes the messages to a model provider. Chat content here is governed by OpenRouter and each provider's policies.\n# Privacy with OpenRouter\nBy default, OpenRouter does not store prompts or responses unless you opt in. However, in order to answer your requests, your messages are sent to a Model provider. Model providers each have their own privacy and data retention policy. Providers typically fall into one of three camps. Indefinite data retention (like OpenAI), 30-day retention (like Anthropic), and Zero Data Retention (Like Fireworks). You can manually configure the providers that you would like to handle your requests to ensure that your privacy and data retention needs are met, by configuring the provider settings in your OpenRouter dashboard. Additionally, OpenRouter provides a setting which enforces answering all requests only with providers with a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy.\n## Models and Providers\nIt should be noted that not all models are available from every provider. You should make sure that any model you select in GxPT is available from the providers you have configured.\n## Settings in GxPT\nGxPT provides a setting to disable provider data collection. This will disallow any providers from handling your request which collect the data from your prompts for use in training future models. It is important to note that this *does not* disable all data retention. In order to enforce ZDR, you must configure the ZDR option in your OpenRouter settings.\n## Documentation & Privacy Settings\n- Privacy & Logging Documentation: https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/privacy-and-logging\n- ZDR Documentation: https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/zdr\n- OpenRouter Privacy settings: https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy"
